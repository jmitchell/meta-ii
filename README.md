# META II

For now the focus is on transcribing D. V. Schorre's paper "META II: A
Syntax-Oriented Compiler Writing Language". The transcription is
mostly complete, aside from a few figures, illustrations, and the
bibliography.

Eventually I may reimplement some of the virtual machines and META II,
primarly as a learning exercise.
